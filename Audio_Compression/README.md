# Audio Comression 

Matlab is used to calculate least-squares estimates of the coefficients and
residuals for a given speech signal sample data set. These residuals are 
quantized instead of the original speech signal to minimize the dynamic range
of bits being transmitted to speed up data transfer rate. The difference in
the mean squared-error for the directly quantized speech signal and the signal
reconstructed from the quantized residuals is compared to demonstrate
effectiveness.
