# BreweryTracking

This simple and fun side project parses through a text file of all San Diego brewery names/locations and outputs to an excel doc of file type extension .xlsx. Its purpose in parsing is to remove unwanted characters and separate name and location items into two columns for organizational purposes. My plan is to one day have a beer at every brewery in the greater San Diego area!
